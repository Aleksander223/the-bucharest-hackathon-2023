# Implementation

## Genezio 
We start by configuring a Genezio server to host our cloud functions that get the selected snippet, sends it to ChatGPT with some engineered prompts, and return the commented block. We went for a HTTP Server aproach that is fully suported by Genezio.

## CI/CD with Github
In order to automate all our tasks we opted for Github actions, granting us the possibility of having a secured and always ready-to-go application.
