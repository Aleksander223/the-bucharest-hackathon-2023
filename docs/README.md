# Introduction
Understand, comment and document your code with 0 effort

## Why is this useful?
As engineers working with web development and AI, we stumble quite often over code written by our beloved collages that seem to be closer to hieroglyphs than typescript or python. Letâ€™s not even talk about junior onboarding.

"Cool name" helps you comment your code when you just don't have time for it or want to get the bigger picture. 
You can just select a code snippet and comment it or even add it to a markdown documentation to be overviewed later by fellow team members and help you remember what you commited yesterday.

# Getting started
## VS Code Extension
Just grab the latest patch and add it to your github extensions with drag and drop.

Now you should be able to select a code snipped, right click and select the last option "comment code". After some seconds, your code will be commented without breaking anything.
